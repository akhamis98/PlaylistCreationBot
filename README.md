# AppleMusicToSpotifyDiscordBot

The goal of this bot is for Spotify users to easily be able to play song links sent by Apple Music users.

This bot read's embeds on apple music links in Discord text channels and sends back a corresponding spotify link.

You can use this link to invite my bot (not always online) to your server: https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=650540610578677770&permissions=93184&scope=bot

Or you can host a bot yourself using the code provided (uses node).

Simply create a bot, put your bot token into auth.json, create a Spotify developer account, and put that auth token into auth.json, and it is good to go!
